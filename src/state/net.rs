//! Deliberately small, and it will stay smaller than it looks like it should.
//! What belongs here is the state a *header* has to read, because that is the

/// Whether the receiver is walking the band or sitting on one channel.

/// **This changes what every number below it means**, which is why it is the
/// first field in the header and why it is never absent. A duty cycle measured
/// while sweeping is a sample of a channel; measured while locked it is that
/// channel's whole story. Design section 13.1 makes every panel say which one it
/// is looking at.
