//! **Everyone thinks about this band in channels, not in hertz.** A header that
//! says 2437.000 MHz is correct and useless; one that says channel 6 is what the
//! person in front of it is actually holding in their head. So the conversion
//! lives here, once, and every panel that needs it asks rather than deriving it
//! again with its own rounding.
//!
//! Wi-Fi numbering only, for now. Bluetooth's own channel maps arrive with the
//! arc that needs them, because a header showing "ch 6" for Wi-Fi and "ch 6" for
//! BLE would be naming two different frequencies with one label.

/// The 2.4 GHz ISM band itself, 2400 to 2483.5 MHz.

/// **Wi-Fi channel 14 is centred above this**, at 2484 MHz, half a megahertz
/// past the top. That is the plan and not a mistake: the channel is Japan-only
/// and 802.11b-only, and most of its emission falls below the edge. A radio
/// tuned there is off the right end of any rail drawn over the band, which is
/// the honest picture rather than a band stretched to hide it.
///
/// **Not the same as the range the gate requires.** The gate asks whether a
/// radio can reach every centre frequency this section tunes to, and the lowest
/// of those is 2402 MHz, not 2400. These two are the band; those are the
/// requirement. Keeping them separate is what stops a rail drawn over the band
